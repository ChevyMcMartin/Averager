C# Practice Console App - Takes numbers as input from user until they type 'done' and finds the average. Validations included.

Here is the practice challenge from teamtreehouse:
"Repeatedly prompt the user for numbers. Add all of the numbers together. When the user types in “done”, print the average of all of the numbers by dividing the total by the number of numbers entered."
